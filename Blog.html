            <p class="games-desc">- Minecraft is a three-dimensional video game in 
                which players build and destroy various types of blocks. 
                Survival and Creative are the game's two main modes. 
                Players in Survival must gather their own building materials and food. 
                They also interact with moving creatures and blocklike mobs.
                (Dangerous creatures include creepers and zombies.) 
                In Creative, players are given provisions and do not need to eat to survive. 
                They can also instantly break any type of block.</p>

    <h2 class="gameTitle">AXIE INFINITY</h2>
    <div class="content">
            <p class="games-desc">- Axie Infinity is currently in the trend due to its play to earn feature. 
                And considering that players would only have to play this game for at least 2 hours a day on their phone or computer, 
                makes it even more convenient for people juggling between other workloads.  
                The mechanics is easy, players just have to win in battles in order to gain slp - the currency in Axie. 
                Wins lead to higher rankings, which then leads to higher slp gain. 
                Players are usually given opportunities by "managers" or people who invest and buy teams to provide for those who cannot afford it, 
                while players who are able to avail this opportunity are called "scholars". However, 
                there are also independent players who buys their own team - giving them 100% ownership and income from their game play.   </p>
